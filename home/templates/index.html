    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>I love running. I run to work throughout the week and then 
        race around the Great British Countryside all weekend. I've always struggled to find stock of 
        the fastest running shoes in one place. Whenever I go into a running shop they always have very limited choice of 
        racing shoes and whenever I look online the choice is overwhelming but there is never enough detail about the shoe and what they are 
        like to run in for me to make an informed decision. I set up this shop to change that. We take the leading 
        models of a particular type of shoe and go and run around in them... a lot. We then report back on the best aspects of
        each shoe to help you make the best investment and race the fastest.
    </p>

        Our pricing fairly reflects the cost of selling the shoe to you. We're a small family run business and we do't have 
        any economies of scale. We buy all the shoes we test and seek to highlight there best features so you can make an informed decision.
